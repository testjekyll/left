I just finished reading "[Metaprogramming in .NET](http://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-NET-Kevin-Hazzard/dp/1617290262/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378022940&sr=8-1&keywords=metaprogramming+in+.net)" by Kevin Hazzard and Jason Bock and I must say it was a really interesting reading.

The book starts with the definition of metaprogramming : 
> a computer program that writes new computer programs

and begins to explore the available techniques like **Reflection** ( the ability to inspect your code at runtime and modify the program behaviour based on this information), **Reflection.Emit** ( the ability to dynamically create types and methods at runtime to  improve perfomance), the usage of the **Expression** class or **IL Rewriting**.

The contents of this book are too extensive to be described in a post but if you write code that's a little above the basic I strongly suggest to read it, it will be able to give you some great ideas.
